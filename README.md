# Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to create a weather prediction system using machine learning. Weather prediction plays a crucial role in various sectors including agriculture, transportation, energy management, disaster preparedness, and more. Our project aims to use weather data and machine learning models to provide accurate and localized weather predictions. By integrating historical weather data, geographical features, atmospheric conditions, and other relevant parameters, our system will forecast weather patterns with high precision and reliability.
