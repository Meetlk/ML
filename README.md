# Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to create a weather prediction system using machine learning. Weather prediction plays a crucial role in various sectors including agriculture, transportation, energy management, disaster preparedness, and more. Our project aims to use weather data and machine learning models to provide accurate and localized weather predictions. By integrating historical weather data, geographical features, atmospheric conditions, and other relevant parameters, our system will forecast weather patterns with high precision and reliability.

## Dependencies
To run the scripts in this repository, the following libraries are required:

* numpy
* pandas
* serial
* time
* cv2
* scikit-learn

## Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique used in machine learning for predicting a quantitative response based on one or more predictor variables. In the context of weather prediction, linear regression can be applied to model the relationship between various meteorological parameters (such as temperature, humidity, pressure) and the target variable (e.g., rainfall amount, wind speed).

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries (mention specific libraries).
3. Download and pre-process weather data (if applicable).
4. Train the machine learning model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
